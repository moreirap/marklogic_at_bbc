This is an example application demonstrating the ability to rapidly create an end-to-end XQuery prototype using tools freely available on the developer.marklogic.com web site. The application was built using 170 lines of XML configuration and 80 lines of custom XQuery code, and leveraged the following tools:

o Versi - Available on the Workshop Page
o lib-search - Available on the Workshop Page
o search-ui - Available in the XQuery Commons in the http directory
o lib-uitools - Available in the XQuery Commons in the http directory

Please note that MarkLogic 3.2 is required to run this application and the latest releases of the above libraries were used as of 6/13/2008. The application will not be updated as new libraries are released.

Full documentation is available in the /docs/ directory.
